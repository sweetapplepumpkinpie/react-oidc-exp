I will like to give you some more details, which might be helpful. I initially tried to do this myself and followed this post:
https://medium.com/@franciscopa91/how-to-implement-oidc-authentication-with-react-context-api-and-react-router-205e13f2d49



It is old code so I made some changes. Also changed the library from oid-client to oidc-client-ts
My main issue has been that after login I have not been able to save user token and retrieve user data. Some of the issues I faced were same as described on this post:

So just wanted to give you this info, in case it is helpful. And I don't mind if you reuse the code from these posts. As long as it is working, I'm fine with it
